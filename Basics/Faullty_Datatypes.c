/*
 * File: 01.c
 * ----------
 * Correction: This code is fundamentally broken.
 * 1. 'b' is used in 'a + b' before it's initialized, leading to undefined behavior.
 * 2. printf("%f", &b) attempts to print the memory address of 'b' as if it were a
 * float value, which is incorrect.
 * The code is corrected to initialize 'b' and print its value correctly.
