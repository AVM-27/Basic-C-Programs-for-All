 * Filename    : Arrays/array1.c
 * Description : Reads an integer n and stores the squares of 0 to n-1 in an array,
 *               then prints each square with its index.
 * Author      : Adarsh Venugopal (https://github.com/AVM-27)
 * Date        : 2025-08-02
 *
 * Program Details:
 *  - Prompts the user to enter the size of the array.
 *  - Creates an array of size n to hold integer squares.
 *  - Computes the square of each index and stores it in the array.
 *  - Prints the index and corresponding square stored.
 *
 * Input:
 *  - Size of array (n), a positive integer.
 *
 * Output:
 *  - For each index i (0 to n-1), prints the square of i.
 *
 * Example:
 *  Enter the size of your integer squares array
 *  5
 *  At index 0 the square stored is 0
 *  At index 1 the square stored is 1
 *  At index 2 the square stored is 4
 *  At index 3 the square stored is 9
 *  At index 4 the square stored is 16
