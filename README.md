# 🧠 Basic-C-Programs-for-All

A crash course in C, minus the crashing.  
This repo is for anyone who opened a `.c` file, blinked twice, and whispered _“printf what now?”_

> _“I didn’t choose the C life. The C life `#included` me.”_

## 📌 What’s This?

A curated collection of beginner-level C programs, lovingly debugged, renamed, cleaned up, and heavily commented so even your future self understands what’s going on.

Designed for:
- 💥 C newcomers
- 🎓 ECE/EEE/CS students
- 🤖 Anyone forced into coding against their will (and learning to enjoy it)

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Actual working code (no `main()`s missing semicolons here)
- 🧾 Vivado-style headers at the top of each file
- 🧠 Inline comments explaining each line like a helpful TA
- 💡 Logical filenames (yes, `23_fibonacci.c` is actually a Fibonacci program)

> _Every line either does something… or explains why it exists._
